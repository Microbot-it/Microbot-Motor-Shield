## Arduino library for the Dual DC Motor Shield V2
The **Dual DC Motor Shield V2** is a shield that has been designed to enable an Arduino board to drive two brushed DC motors or one 4-wire two-phase stepper motor, controlling the speed and direction of each one independently.<br/>
Motor speed and direction are controlled by a potentiometer, Shield temperature and current absorption are monitored on Serial Monitor.
## Library installation
If you are using version 1.6.2 or later of the Arduino software (IDE), you can use the Library Manager to install this library:
1. In the Arduino IDE, open the "Sketch" menu, select "Include Library", then "Manage Libraries...".
2. Search for "Microbot-Motor-Shield".
3. Click the Microbot-Motor-Shield entry in the list.
4. Click "Install".<br/>

If this does not work, you can manually install the library:
1. Download the [latest release archive from GitHub](https://github.com/Microbot-it/Microbot-Motor-Shield/tags) and decompress it.
2. Rename the folder "Microbot-Motor-Shield-xxxx" to "Microbot-Motor-Shield".
3. Drag the "Microbot-Motor-Shield" folder into the "libraries" directory inside your Arduino sketchbook directory. You can view your sketchbook location by opening the "File" menu and selecting "Preferences" in the Arduino IDE. If there is not already a "libraries" folder in that location, you should make the folder yourself.
4. After installing the library, restart the Arduino IDE.
